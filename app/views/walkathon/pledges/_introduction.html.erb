<p>Dear Sponsor:</p>
<p>I’m participating in the Fairwood School Walkathon on October 24th. The Walkathon will raise funds to provide
  the teachers with supplemental resources, classroom supplies, assemblies and enriched curriculum opportunities.
  You can sponsor me by making a pledge per lap, which can be capped, or by making a pre-set donation.
  Pre-set donations can be collected before the walk. If you pledge by lap, I’ll let you know how many laps I
  walked and will collect your pledge later. Checks can be made payable to <strong>Fairwood Explorer Alliance</strong>.
  All contributions are tax-deductible.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support!</p>
